## 📝 IF JUDGES ASK:

**Q: "Why localStorage?"**
**A:** "For the demo, localStorage is perfect. In production, we'd integrate Firebase or a custom backend API. The architecture supports easy migration."

**Q: "Does it scale?"**
**A:** "The current version is optimized for demo. The modular design allows easy integration with cloud databases like Firebase, MongoDB, or PostgreSQL for production scale."

**Q: "Can it sync across devices?"**
**A:** "Not in this demo version, but the connection manager and message system are designed to work with any backend. We can add Firebase in 30 minutes for cross-device sync."
